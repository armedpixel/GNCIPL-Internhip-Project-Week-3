Unsupervised Fashion Image Clustering

This project demonstrates an unsupervised approach to clustering fashion images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. It uses a pre-trained VGG16 CNN for feature extraction and the K-Means algorithm to group similar images. The project notebook includes detailed steps on data exploration, model implementation, and performance evaluation using metrics like the Silhouette Score and Adjusted Rand Index. Visualizations, including a t-SNE plot, are used to provide a clear understanding of the clustering results.
